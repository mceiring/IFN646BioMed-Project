# **Data**
## Introduction
This directory contains the data used for our project, which focuses on the genome of the fruit fly ([Drosophila melanogaster](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/taxonomy/7227/)). The fruit fly is a widely used experimental model organism with a relatively small genome, making it ideal for our research.

## Data Source
The data for this project has been sourced from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). You can access the data by following these steps:

1. Visit the fruit fly page on the NCBI website: NCBI Drosophila melanogaster
2. Scroll down to the download button.
3. Select "RefSeq only" from the available options.
4. Download the following files:
    - Genome sequences (FASTA)
    - Annotation (GTF)
    - Transcripts (FASTA)

The downloaded data will be in a zip file of ~68MB.

## File Structure
After downloading and unzipping the file, you should have the following types of files:
- **Genome Sequences (FASTA):** These files contain the nucleotide sequences for the fruit fly genome.
- **Annotation (GTF):** This file contains annotations for the genome, such as gene locations and features.
- **Transcripts (FASTA):** These files contain the transcript sequences.

## Usage
To use the data, simply refer to the respective files in your code or analysis tool. Make sure to set the correct file paths.

## Recommendations
- Always verify the integrity of the downloaded files.
- Keep a backup of the original data files for reference.

## Licence & NCBI Datasets Documentation
The data is publicly available and can be freely used for academic and research purposes. For more details on the licence, please refer to the NCBI website.
